# Code Review

Hello,

Please take a look at files inside these dirs:  
```markdown
/blade
/vue
```

There you can see example files **with many problems** and **legacy code**.

We would want you to review these files and **share your thoughts** with us.

- What is wrong with the code/markup?
- What are your suggestions on how to improve the code? Where would you start?

Our team is searching for new devs, so we would like to get a view about your 
skills, expertise, and the **way you're thinking**.

Notes:
- We are not expecting the best/perfect solution or complete review. Choose any piece of code you want.
- We are not asking you to go into logic or how it works, we would want to discuss the code and its structure.

You can fork this repository and create a PR with your notes, or just use comments or write to us personally. Any way you like.

Best Regards.
